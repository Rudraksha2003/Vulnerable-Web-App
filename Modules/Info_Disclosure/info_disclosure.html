                <h3>Significance</h3>
                <p>
                    Sensitive Information Disclosure vulnerabilities occur when critical data, such as credentials, 
                    API keys, or other sensitive information, is exposed in source code, logs, or responses. When credentials 
                    are hardcoded into JavaScript files, attackers can easily retrieve them, especially in client-side applications, 
                    compromising security.

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    The impact of exposing sensitive information is severe. Attackers can use the hardcoded credentials 
                    to access backend systems, databases, or third-party services. This can lead to unauthorized data access, 
                    system compromise, API abuse, or cascading vulnerabilities across interconnected systems.

            <div class="theory-section">
                <h3>Remediation</h3>
                <p>
                    To remediate this issue, never hardcode sensitive information in JavaScript or any client-facing files. 
                    Use environment variables or secure vaults to manage credentials securely on the server side. 
                    Ensure that sensitive data is stored securely and never exposed to the client. Regularly audit 
                    codebases and repositories for exposed secrets using tools like TruffleHog.
