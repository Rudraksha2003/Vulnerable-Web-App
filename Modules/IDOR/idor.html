                <h3>Significance</h3>
                <p>
                    An IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability occurs when an application exposes direct access to 
                    objects (e.g., database records, files, or user data) without proper authorization checks. 
                    It is significant because attackers can exploit it to access, modify, or delete resources they are not 
                    authorized to interact with, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    The impact of an IDOR vulnerability can be severe. It may compromise sensitive information such as personal user 
                    data, financial records, or confidential documents. In extreme cases, it can lead to reputational damage, 
                    legal consequences, or regulatory fines for the affected organization, especially if it violates privacy 
                    laws like GDPR.

                <h3>Remediation</h3>
                <p>
                    To remediate IDOR vulnerabilities, always enforce strict access controls and authorization checks 
                    on every request, not just at the user interface level. Avoid exposing direct references 
                    (e.g., user IDs or file names) and use indirect or hashed identifiers wherever possible. 
                    Conduct regular security testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
