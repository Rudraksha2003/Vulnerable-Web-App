                <h3>Significance</h3>
                <p>
                    SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability where attackers manipulate SQL queries by injecting 
                    malicious input into user-supplied fields. It is significant because it can provide unauthorized 
                    access to sensitive data, allow attackers to modify or delete database contents, or even execute 
                    administrative operations on the database.

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    The impact of SQL Injection can be devastating, as it may lead to data breaches, data loss, or 
                    compromise of the entire database. In severe cases, attackers can gain full control of the 
                    underlying server, escalate privileges, or disrupt the application's functionality, leading to 
                    significant financial and reputational losses.

                <h3>Remediation</h3>
                <p>
                    To remediate SQL Injection, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of 
                    directly embedding user input into SQL queries. Avoid dynamic SQL wherever possible and validate 
                    and sanitize all user inputs. Additionally, implement least privilege access for database accounts 
                    and conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
