                <h3>Significance</h3>
                <p>
                    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into 
                    web pages viewed by other users. It is significant because it can be exploited to steal sensitive user data, 
                    hijack user sessions, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, compromising both 
                    individual users and the application's integrity.

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    The impact of XSS can range from minor nuisances to critical security issues. For example, attackers 
                    can steal login credentials, deliver malware, or impersonate users. Persistent XSS on high-traffic 
                    websites can have far-reaching consequences, damaging trust, leading to data leaks, and incurring 
                    regulatory penalties if user data is mishandled.

                <h3>Remediation</h3>
                <p>
                    To remediate XSS, sanitize and validate all user inputs to remove or neutralize harmful scripts 
                    before rendering them in the browser. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the execution 
                    of unauthorized scripts. Encode data properly when displaying it in HTML, JavaScript, or other contexts, 
                    and avoid directly inserting user input into the DOM.
